An object, on the other hand can be a data structure, but also any other variable or a function.

    "In the rest of this chapter you are going to learn the following key elements of good programming practices, which you will then build upon in subsequent chapters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Adhering to these practices will result in more maintainable, efficient, and scalable code, enhancing collaboration and reducing future technical load, **irrespective of programming language**. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Clear, Readable Code**\n",
    "   - Use names that clearly describe their purpose (meaningful variable / function / object names).\n",
    "   - Stick to a single naming convention/style (e.g., [camelCase](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase), [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case)).\n",
    "   - Provide concise comments and document code sections to explain their logic, especially for complex parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make it Modular to the Max!**\n",
    "   - Functions (or \"methods\" - coming up later below) should perform one task (the [\"Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)).\n",
    "   - Break down large tasks into smaller, reusable functions.\n",
    "   - Avoid duplicating code; encapsulate repetitive logic in functions ([the \"Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\" principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**\n",
    "   - Use `try-except` blocks or other error-handling mechanisms to anticipate failures and handle them without crashing the program (coming up later in this Chapter).\n",
    "   - Provide meaningful error messages that help others (and yourself in the future!) understand what went wrong and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test, Test, Test!**\n",
    "   - Write automated tests for individual units of code to ensure they behave as expected.\n",
    "   - Test code during development to catch bugs before they become difficult to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **[Version Control](./03-Git.ipynb)**\n",
    "   - Commit frequently, with clear commit messages describing the purpose of the changes.\n",
    "   - Develop new features, solutions, or bug fixes in separate branches to avoid conflicts in the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Optimization**\n",
    "   - Write code that minimizes time (make it faster) and space (make its RAM usage smaller) complexity where possible.\n",
    "   - But focus first on functionality, then optimize only where performance is actually a bottleneck. Remember Donald Knuth's quote: \"*Premature optimizaton is the root of all evil*\"! \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Use Consistent Code Style**\n",
    "   - Adhere to style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python - coming up below) to keep code consistent.\n",
    "   - Use automated tools to enforce coding standards and detect errors (use code formatting and linting tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Review Code**\n",
    "   - Have others review your code to catch issues and get feedback on design and implementation.\n",
    "   - Collaborative - use feedback from opthers to refine code and learn better practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Avoid Hardcoding!**\n",
    "   - Avoid hardcoding parameter values (e.g., absolute file paths, values of certain constants, settings) directly into the program. Use external inputs, global constants and external configuration files instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Refactor Regularly**\n",
    "   - Continuously improve code by removing redundancies, simplifying logic, or improving structure without changing functionality (aka \"Refactoring code\").\n",
    "   - Watch for and address patterns that indicate poor design (software nerds call it \"Code smell detection\"!):\n",
    "       - Duplicated code lines/blocks\n",
    "       - Overly complex functions (too long, performing multiple tasks, difficult to understand)\n",
    "       - Tightly coupled code (different components/functions/modules are so dependent on each other that changes in one requires changes in the other(s)). "

    "So, you need to employ `deepcopy` to really copy an existing object or variable and assign a new name to the copy. So, in summary, shallow copying an object won't create objects that are independent clones, i.e., the copy is not fully independent of the original. A deep copy of an object will recursively clone \"child\" objects (like nested parts of a list). The clone is fully independent of the original, but creating a deep copy is slower, as it involves assigning new memory space. Keep in mind that this shallow vs. deep copy business does  not just apply to lists. You can copy arbitrary objects (including custom classes) with the copy module.\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "**Why Python \"shallow\" copies objects:** This is a bit of a technical detail, but important to keep in mind: Python does shallow copying of mutable objects for (computing) performance considerations. By not copying the underlying object when you re-assign a mutable object to a new (\"variable\") name, Python avoids unnecessary memory usage. This is known as \"passing by reference\" (in contrast to passing by \"value\", where a new variable would be actually created in memory). That does not change the fact that shallow vs. deep copying can be confusing, of course!\n",

Here by using `#!/usr/bin/env python3` we are specifying the location to the python executable in your machine that the rest of the script needs to be interpreted with.

    "### Align DNA sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Open `align_seqs.py` from TheMulQuaBio's code directory. This script aligns two DNA sequences such that they are as similar as possible. Run the script and make sure you understand what every line is doing. A good way to do this, now that you have learnt debugging, is to insert a breakpoint (`import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`) at key locations in the script and examine what is going on. For example, inserting one just after the start of the `for` loop of the `calculate_score` function/module is a good place.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The aligning algorithm is simple. Start by positioning the beginning of the shorter sequence at all positions (bases) of the longer one (the start position), and count the number of bases matched downstream. Then, for each start position, count the \"score\" as total of number of bases matched. The alignment with the highest score wins. Ties are possible, in which case, you just take the an arbitrary alignment (e.g., first or last) with the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert `align_seqs.py` to a Python program that takes the DNA sequences as an input from a single external file and saves the best alignment along with its corresponding score in a single text file (your choice of format and file type) to an appropriate location. No external input should be required; that is, you should still only need to use `python align_seq.py` to run it.\n",
    "    For example, the input file can be a single `.csv` file with the two example sequences given at the top of the original script.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Groupwork Practical on Align DNA sequences \n",
    "\n",
    "Align all the `.fasta` sequences from the [Unix chapter](./01-Unix.ipynb). Call the new script `align_seqs_fasta.py`. Unlike `align_seqs.py`, this script should take *any* two fasta sequences (in separate files) to be aligned as input. So this script would typically run by using explicit inputs, for example, when called with something like: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 align_seqs_fasta.py seq1.fasta seq2.fasta\n",

    "        my_best_align = \".\" * i + s2\n",
    "        my_best_score = z\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `if z > my_best_score` condition means that when a new alignment has the same score as the current one, the current one will be kept and the new one discarded. As a result, multiple alignments with the same score will be lost even if they are all equally good alignments (highly likely in longer sequences), with only the first one retained. \n",

    "If you wrote good doctests, you will find another bug that you might not have by just debugging (hint: what happens if you try the doctest with \"Quercuss\" instead of \"Quercus\"? Should this pass or fail?). \n",
    "\n",

    "Indeed, computational speed may not be your initial concern. Also, you should focus on developing clean, reliable, reusable code rather than worrying first about how fast your code runs. However, speed will become an issue when and if your analysis or modeling becomes complex enough (e.g., food web or large network simulations). In that case, knowing which parts of your code take the most time is useful – optimizing those parts may save you lots of time. \n",

    "The difference between `tottime` and `cumtime` columns often holds the most important information about performance. For example, in the above output, `cumtime` is much higher than `tottime` for `my_join` than for `my_squares`. This is because the sub-function (method) `join` is taking an additional 2.502 seconds (due to 10000001 calls), giving a `cumtime` of 2.698 + 2.502 = 5.2 seconds. In comparison, the sub-function (method) `append` is taking an additional 0.397 seconds (due to 10000008 calls), giving a `cumtime` of 3.335 + 0.397 = 3.732 seconds. Note also that the `tottime`s for `join` and `append` include the \"overhead\" of running their respective loop.\n",

In other words, `.join`ing the string, and `.append`ing values to a list repeatedly are both not particularly fast, though the latter is less costly.\n",

    "We have now had fairly extensive practice in iteratively creating solutions to problems using for loops. Thus far all our problems have been mathematically quite straightforward, and not very computationally intensive. As you begin to move on from your taught modules into project work, you may find yourselves solving larger and more complex problems, at which point you will start to discover that for-loops have a fundamental weakness - speed!\n",

    "* Loops (at least in Python) are not generally able to take advantage of the parallel computing capabilities of modern-day computers, and thus must literally compute a solution one loop iteration at a time. vectorized functions tend to be optimised to spread their computations over multiple processors/threads, which can be much faster!\n",

    "Thus vectorizing your code can have it running in a fraction of the time it otherwise would. Why not always vectorize then?\n",

For example, `your@email.com` is a specific sequence of characters, but, in fact, all email addresses have such a pattern: alphanumeric characters, a \"@\", alphanumeric characters, a \".\", alphanumeric characters. Using regex, you can search for all email addresses in a text file by searching for this pattern.    \n",

    "\n",
    "|Metacharacter|Description|\n",

    "| `.` |\tMatch any character except line break (newline); e.g.,\t`he..o` will match *hello* as well as *he12o*\t|\n",
    "|`^` |\tIndicates that the string to be matched is at the start of a longer string; e.g., `^hello` will match \"hello\" in \"hello fellow!\", but not in \"fellow, hello!\" |\n",
    "|`$` |\tMatch the end of a string; for example, `world$` will match \"world\" in \"Hello world\", but not in \"Hello world!\"  \t|\n",

So, for example, `ra+t` will match \"rat\" (one 'a' is present) and \"raaat\" (three \"a\"s), but won't match \"rt\". On the other hand, `?` matches a pattern either once or zero times, so it makes the pattern matching more flexible. For example, `home-?brew` matches either \"homebrew\" or \"home-brew\".\n",
